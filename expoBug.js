This error typically occurs when you're using Expo's `expo start` command and it fails to start the development server. This can be due to several reasons including port conflicts, incorrect project setup, or issues with the Expo CLI itself.  The error message might not be very descriptive, making debugging challenging. For example, you might see a generic error such as  `Error: listen EADDRINUSE: address already in use :::19000` or the server might just hang indefinitely without any clear indication of the problem.

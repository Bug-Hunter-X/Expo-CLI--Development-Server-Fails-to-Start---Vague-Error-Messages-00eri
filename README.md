# Expo CLI: Development Server Fails to Start

This repository demonstrates a common yet frustrating issue with the Expo CLI: the development server failing to start without providing clear error messages. This can be due to various reasons such as port conflicts, incorrect project setup, or problems with the Expo CLI itself.

The `expoBug.js` file contains a minimal Expo project that might exhibit the problem (though the issue is not within the code itself; it's related to the Expo CLI's environment and configuration).

The `expoBugSolution.js` file offers potential solutions and troubleshooting steps.  The primary solutions involve checking for port conflicts, verifying project setup, reinstalling the Expo CLI, and checking system resources.

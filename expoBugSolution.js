Troubleshooting Steps:

1. **Check for Port Conflicts:** The most common cause is a port conflict. Expo's development server usually runs on port 19000 (or 19001 if 19000 is unavailable).  Check if another application is using this port. Use tools like `netstat -a -b` (Windows) or `lsof -i :19000` (macOS/Linux) to identify any processes using these ports. If a conflict is found, stop the conflicting application or change Expo's port using the `--port` flag:  `expo start --port 19002`

2. **Verify Project Setup:** Ensure your Expo project is correctly set up. Check your `package.json` and `app.json` files to verify the project configuration. 

3. **Reinstall Expo CLI:** Sometimes, a corrupted installation of the Expo CLI can cause issues. Try reinstalling it: `npm uninstall -g expo-cli` followed by `npm install -g expo-cli`.

4. **Check System Resources:** Make sure your system has enough available resources (memory and CPU) to run the Expo development server.

5. **Clear Cache:** Try clearing the Expo CLI cache using: `expo prebuild --clear`

6. **Check for Firewall Issues:** Ensure that your firewall isn't blocking the Expo development server. 

7. **Update Expo CLI:** Ensure you have the latest version of the Expo CLI installed using `npm update -g expo-cli`

If none of these steps work, provide more details about your system, the exact error message (if any), and your project setup for further assistance.
